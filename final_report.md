# pEHR Application Audit and Cleanup Report

## Overview

This report summarizes the findings from a comprehensive audit of the pEHR application codebase and details the changes made to address identified issues.

## Audit Findings

### Working Features
- **DashboardView**: Loads correctly with metrics placeholders
- **SettingsView**: UI loads properly but theme switching was not functional
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Buttons are clickable and navigate to corresponding views
- **Logout Functionality**: Working as expected
- **Main Layout**: Sidebar, top bar, and content area layout working correctly

### Broken or Unimplemented Features
- **CalendarView**: Basic UI loads but core functionality (dragging, resizing events, color-coding) not implemented
- **Other Views**: Many views (Patients, Appointments, Prescriptions, Maintenance) have minimal or no implementation
- **Theme Switching**: UI exists but changing themes had no visual effect
- **Test Components**: Several test buttons and views were present throughout the application

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Test Components
- Removed test buttons from DashboardView
- Removed embedded ButtonTestView from DashboardView
- Removed "Test Buttons" and "Sidebar Test" from sidebar menu
- Removed test items from MenuItems collection in MainWindowViewModel
- Removed test view case statements from NavigateToMenuItem method
- Removed test ViewModel registrations from DependencyInjection

### 2. Fixed Theme Switching
- Improved the ThemeManager.ApplyTheme method to properly handle style application
- Enhanced theme initialization in App.axaml.cs
- Added proper cleanup of existing styles before applying new ones
- Added additional theme application after UI is fully loaded

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. **Complete CalendarView Functionality**:
   - Implement event dragging and resizing
   - Add dialogs for creating and editing events
   - Complete color-coding implementation

2. **Implement Missing Views**:
   - Complete PatientsView with patient management functionality
   - Complete AppointmentsView with appointment scheduling
   - Complete PrescriptionsView with prescription management
   - Complete MaintenanceView with system maintenance features

### Medium Priority
1. **Improve Navigation System**:
   - Consider implementing a dedicated navigation service
   - Ensure all views are properly registered

2. **Enhance UI/UX**:
   - Improve consistency across views
   - Add loading indicators for async operations
   - Implement proper error handling and user feedback

### Low Priority
1. **Code Refactoring**:
   - Reduce code duplication across ViewModels
   - Improve separation of concerns
   - Add comprehensive unit tests

## Conclusion

The pEHR application has a solid foundation with working navigation and basic views. The cleanup tasks have removed unnecessary test components and fixed the theme switching functionality. The next steps should focus on implementing the core functionality in the remaining views, particularly the CalendarView which appears to be a central feature of the application.

With the current changes, the application is more streamlined and the theme switching now works correctly, providing a better foundation for further development.
